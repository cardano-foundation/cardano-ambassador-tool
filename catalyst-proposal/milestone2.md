# Milestone Report

The stated milestone Outcomes of this milestone had been stated as:
- 	
Successful formalised collaborations with Cardano builders to develop 2 prioritised tools will mark the acceptance Criteria of this Milestone which will be presented as a publicly available document outlining the collaborators and the scope of the collaboration.

## Formalised Collaborations

We successfully initiated collaborations with 2 builder projects who join the project to lead on the development of the tools:

### 1) SIDAN Lab
Represented by Hinson Wong

SIDAN Lab joins the collaboration to focus on the Ambassador platform backend development and the creation of the payment tool.

SIDAN Lab is a Cardano developer project based in Singapore, well known for their contribution at the cardano open source developer ecosystem as well for DeltaDefi and for orgnising and hosting online & offline community events

### 2) Lidonation
Represented by Darlington Kofa

Lidonation joins the collaboration to focus on the Ambassador platform frontend development as well as the hosting of the platform.

Lidonation is a well known Cardano builder project with a long track record in building community tools, especially around Project Catalyst and Cardano Governance as well as constant efforts in education & onboarding of newcomers to the Cardano ecosystem

## Terms
- All development work takes place on a open source github repository
> (currently at https://github.com/sidan-lab/cardano-ambassador-tool , tho notice, we will move the repository at a later stage under the github organisation of the Cardano Foundation)
- For communication, we use a private Discord group chat with the leads and developers from both teams
- Additional bi-weekly meetings via google-meet take place to sync on previous, present and future coordinations of workloads and tasks
- Funds are managed via a multisig with signers from both projects
- Funding allocations are set at 50,000.00 Ada to each project (SIDAN Lab & Lidonation)

## Else
The development and coordination of the tools happens in close synchronisation and collaboration with the Cardano Foundation, namely Sebastian Aravena, manager of the Cardano Ambassadors program to ensure that the project aligns with the Cardano Ambassador Program.

Notice:
> No funds are allocated to the Cardano Foundation

### And thats it
For now, the work on Milestone 3 is in full progress. Thanks for your review and assessment, we hope that all information is provided to approve of the completion of the second milestone of this proposal
