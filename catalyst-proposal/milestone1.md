# Milestone 1 Report

**Huhuu & happy day there**

Since we had to go through a proposal change request, we had some heavy delays on the proposal. However, everything is set now and here we go, reporting on the successful completion of the first Milestone of this proposal which had been completed in Q1 2025 but we have not been able to submit due to Change Request delays.

## What wanted to be achieved in this milestone:

- Host 2X Online sessions with Cardano Ambassadors and launch async survey to gather feedback and ideas  
- Launch dedicated channel on Ambassadors Slack  
- Cluster and categorise input into clear items/projects

## Report on Deliverables

### 1. Host 2X Online sessions & launch async survey with Cardano Ambassadors to gather feedback and ideas

The ideation process with Ambassadors to share needs and ideas for tooling to improve the Ambassador program has been completed. We successfully launched the sessions and the survey. While the sessions had attention and participation, the survey did not receive much participation.

### 2. Launch dedicated channel on Ambassadors Slack

Dedicated channels have been set up at the Cardano Foundation â€“ Ambassadors Slack, which is a private Slack server hosted by the Cardano Foundation. The channel was created on **December 31**.

An additional **Discord Group Chat** has been initiated to communicate and coordinate on the development of the Ambassador tools with members of SIDAN Lab, Lidonation, and **Sebastian Aravena**, Cardano Foundation Manager for the Ambassadors program.

### 3. Cluster and categorise input into clear items/projects

We translated all insights and feedback from Ambassadors into a simple list which captures and outlines ideation items into a clear roadmap:

## Conclusion

The ideation was successful and gave us clear ideas and direction on the tools we want to build, namely two tools:

### **Ambassador Platform**  
An online platform/dashboard with rich features to display ambassador profiles and activities.

### **Ambassador Funding Tool**  
Onchain tools to better handle funding distributions within the Ambassadors program.

The further steps of this proposal will focus on executing workloads to realize these objectives.

> **Milestone 2 has also been completed** and the project is currently executing **Milestone 3**. The Proof of Achievement (PoA) for Milestone 2 will be submitted after Milestone Reviewers assess and approve Milestone 1.
