# Cardano Ambassador Tools - The Collaboration

This document outlines the Collaborators and collaboration scope for the development of the Cardano Ambassador tools, a funded proposal at Cardano's Project Catalyst Fund 13.

Find the proposal at:  
https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/13/cardano-open-developers/cardano-ambassador-tools

As outlined in the proposal, the goal is to initially gather feedback and ideas for desired tools to improve the ambassadors program, while building up collaborations with experienced Cardano developer projects who take charge in the actual development and deployment of the tools.  
As of Milestone 2 of the proposal, here is the overview of the selected collaborators as well as the scope of the collaboration.

## The Collaborators

1. **Cardano Ambassadors**  
   Cardano Ambassadors are community members with a strong track record in engaging in the growth of the Cardano ecosystem, dedicated Cardano citizens.

2. **SIDAN Lab**  
   SIDAN Lab is a Cardano developer project based in Singapore, well known for their contributions to the Cardano open-source developer ecosystem, as well as for DeltaDeFi, and for organizing and hosting online & offline community events.

3. **Lidonation**  
   Lidonation is a well-known Cardano builder project with a long track record in building community tools, especially around Project Catalyst and Cardano Governance, as well as constant efforts in education & onboarding of newcomers to the Cardano ecosystem.

4. **Cardano Foundation**  
   The initiator and current maintainer of the Cardano Ambassador Program.

## The Scope

The development scope focuses on the design, development, and deployment of two tools which have been defined through ideation & feedback sessions with Cardano Ambassadors at the proposalâ€™s first milestone, and have been defined as:

1. **Ambassador Platform**  
   A public online platform with rich features, allowing ambassadors to create their user profiles via ambassador ID tokens and providing, for the first time, a detailed view and insights on all Cardano Ambassadors around the globe to the public.

2. **Ambassador Reward Tool**  
   An admin tool for the Ambassador Management which helps in assigning and distributing budgets to Cardano Ambassadors.

The development of the tools is shared across the collaborators as follows:

- **SIDAN Lab** will lead on backend development of the Ambassador tools and administer the respective GitHub repository.  
- **Lidonation** will lead on frontend development and the hosting of the Ambassador tools.  
- **Ambassadors** will lead on ideation & feedback of the tools and manage the overall project journey on (and beyond) the proposal as an independent and community-driven ambassador grassroots initiative.  
- **The Cardano Foundation** supports the project with feedback and advice, and by providing a safe space to host the code. It does not receive any funds from the proposal.

All development of the code base is done on the public open-source repository on GitHub, now moved to a repository under the Cardano Foundation GitHub Org at:  
https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-ambassador-tool

Communications take place on a private Discord channel with members from SIDAN Lab, Lidonation, and the Ambassadors program. Recurring meetings help to discuss specific issues, updates & ideas.

Proposal progress is reported via milestone reports, which can be found at:

## Budget

Both projects SIDAN Lab and Lidonation will receive a total of 50,000.00 Ada each for their development work. This budget is allocated from the total 110,000.00 Ada of the proposal budget. The fund distributions are managed via a multi-signature wallet with signers from Ambassadors, SIDAN Lab & Lidonation. Funds are distributed upon the completion of the Catalyst proposal milestones. Any leftover budget is allocated to Ambassadors supporting the proposal journey.

## Else

Since this proposal is an initial kick-off in building collaborations between the Ambassadors program and Cardano developer projects to build tools that improve the ambassadors program, we aim to think of this initiative long-term and are definitely aiming to build up additional collaborations in the future.
