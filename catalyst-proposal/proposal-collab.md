# Cardano Ambassador Tools - The Collaboration

This document outlines the Collaborators and collaboration scope for the development of the Cardano Ambassador tools, a funded proposal at Cardano's Project Catalyst Fund 13.

Find the proposal at:
https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/13/cardano-open-developers/cardano-ambassador-tools

As outlined in the proposal, the goal is to initially gather feedback and idea for desired tools to improve the ambassadors program, while building up collaborations with experienced Cardano developer projects who take charge in the actual development and deployment of the tools.
As of Milestone 2 of the proposal, here the overview on the selected collaborators as well as the scope of the collaboration.

## The Collaborators

1) Cardano Ambassadors
Cardano Ambassador are community members with an strong track record in engaging in the growth of the Cardano ecosystem, dedicated cardano citizens

2) SIDAN Lab:
SIDAN Lab is a Cardano developer project based in Singapore, well known for their contribution at the Cardano open source developer ecosystem as well for DeltaDefi and for organising and hosting online & offline community events.

3) Lidonation:
Lidonation is a well known Cardano builder project with a long track record in building community tools, especially around Project Catalyst and Cardano Governance as well as constant efforts in education & onboarding of newcomers to the Cardano ecosystem

4) Cardano Foundation
The initiator and current maintainer of the Cardano Ambassador Program


## The Scope

The development scope focuses on the design, development and deployment of two tools which have been defined through ideation & feedback session with Cardano Ambassadors at the proposais first milestone and have been defined as:

1) Ambassador Platform
A public online platform with rich features, allows ambassadors to create their user profiles via ambassador id-tokens and gives a first time a detailed view and insights on all Cardano Ambassadors around the globe to the public

2) Ambassador reward tool
A admin tool for the Ambassador Management which helps in assigning and distributing budgets to Cardano Ambassadors.

The development of the tools is shared across the collaborators such as: 
- SIDAL Lab will lead on backend development of the Ambassador tools and administrate the respective GitHub repository
- Lidonation will lead on frontend development and the hosting of the ambassador tools. 
- Ambassadors will lead on ideation & feedback of the tools and to manage the overall project journey on (and beyond) the proposal as a independent and community driven ambassadors grass root initiative. 
- The Cardano Foundation supports the project with feedback and advise and providing a safe space to host the code, does not receive any funds from the proposal.

All development of the code base is done on the public open source repository on GitHub, now moved at a repository under the Cardano Foundation GitHub Org at: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-ambassador-toolhttps://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-ambassador-tool)

Communications take place on a private Discord channel with members from SIDAN Lab, Lidonation and the Ambassadors program. Recurring meetings help to discuss specific issues, updates & ideas

Proposal progress is reported via milestone reports, which can be found at:

## Budget
Both projects SIDAN Lab and Lidonation will receive a total of 50,000.00 Ada each for their development work. This budget is allocated from the total 110,000.00 Ada of the proposal budget.  The fund distributions are managed via a multi-signature wallet with signers from Ambassadors, SIDAN Lab & Lidonation. Funds are distributed upon the completion of the catalyst proposal milestones. Any leftover budgets are allocated to Ambassadors supporting the proposal journey.

## Else
Since this proposal is a initial kick-off in building collaborations between the Ambassadors program and cardano developer projects to build tools which improve the ambassadors program, we surely aim to think this initiative longterm and we are definitley aiming to build up additional collaborations in the future.
