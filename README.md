# Cardano Ambassador Tool

This is an on-chain project to support Cardano ambassadors.

## Features

### Setup and Onboarding

1. Identity of the "person"

   Every "person" in this dapp is surrounding a token the user brought in. And we build record system around it.

2. Initial Set of administrators

   In setup of the app, an initial set of administrators are alloted with multisig (tentatively 2 out of 3) -> scripts can update

### Members management

1. Member admission

   Passing admin multisig threshold to approve members

2. Member removal

   Full multisig required from admin to remove member and records

3. Rotation of administrators

   Passing quorem can rotate admin

   A script address will be created where Cardano community can donate assets to the treasury.

2. Project Proposal
